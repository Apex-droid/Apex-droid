## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have experience with programming languages â€‹â€‹such as java, c++, golang,  and am willing to learn new technologies. I am committed to producing quality code and am willing to contribute to projects on GitHub. Ready to learn, happy to accept any challenge and ready to work in a team. I will be glad to gain experience and help in the development of projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on web server on golang
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, golang
- âš¡ Fun fact: Fruit-eating birds like waxwings can get drunk, so to speak, when they eat fermented fruit
